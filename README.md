# Practicum100
This is my submission to the extra project of Practicum100 Data Analyst Bootcamp assigned by Cedric Mössner (The Morpheus Tutorials on YoutTube).

The task is to code a TicTacToe game. The code works fairly simple, the user selects a position on the board by inserting a number between 1 to 9. 
The player that gets a straight line vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins the game. Otherwise the game ties.
